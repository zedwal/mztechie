This is a dummy project for those who want to learn grails (especially for beginners).
I used the simple programming techniques those can be easily understandable.
Initially I was writing this grails blog just for fun but during this, I realised that,
this could help may beginners to clear their concepts on grails.

Wiki pages for the project yet not publihed. I will try ASAP.

If u find it helpful, Don't forget to spread.
